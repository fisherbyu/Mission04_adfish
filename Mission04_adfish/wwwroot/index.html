    <p>
        In this class, I'm excited to learn more about web development more generally but also specifically C#.  I have heard the ASP .NET CORE Framework is great for creating applications that exist on the web and mobile, which seems awesome.  Also, I am excited to be learning more about a Strongly Typed Language, which I think will be really good for my career.
